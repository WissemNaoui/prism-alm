Okay, I can help you extract the main parts of this "Rapport de Projet de Fin d'Études" (Final Year Project Report) to use as a structure for another project. I will identify the core sections and sub-sections that define the report's organization.

Core Structure for a Similar Report:

Here's a breakdown of the structure, based on the table of contents:

INTRODUCTION GÉNÉRALE (General Introduction)

This section sets the stage for the project. It covers:

The industry context and the problem being addressed.

The specific goals and objectives of the project.

A brief overview of the proposed solution (in this case, the Currus application).

Thesis statement

CADRE GÉNÉRAL DU PROJET (General Project Context)

This section provides the overall context of the project and should be adjusted depending on the context of your new project

Présentation de l'organisme d'accueil (Presentation of the host organisation, JEMS in this case):

Méthodologie Adoptée (Adopted Methodology)

Présentation SCRUM (SCRUM Presentation)

PLANIFICATION ET ANALYSE DES BESOINS (Planning and Requirements Analysis)

Identification des acteurs (Identification of Actors/Users)

Besoins Fonctionnels (Functional Requirements)

Besoins non fonctionnels (Non-Functional Requirements)

Modélisation des besoins (Modeling of Needs) (typically with UML diagrams)

Equipe (Team)

Backlog produit (Product Backlog)

Plannification des sprints (Sprint Planning)

ENVIRONMENT DE TRAVAIL ET TECHNOLOGIES (Work Environment and Technologies)

This section describes the technical environment and technologies used to develop the system. It explains "how" the project was implemented.

Conception Architecturale (Architectural Design):

Architecture Back-End

Architecture Front end

Environnement de travail (Work Environment):

Environnement matériel (Hardware Environment)

Environnement logiciel (Software Environment)

Outils Technologiques (Technological Tools):

Frameworks

Bibliothèques et APIs (Libraries and APIs)

Cloud et SGBD (Cloud and DBMS)

Contrôle de version (Version Control)

Outils de gestion organisationnelle et de projet (Organizational and Project Management Tools)

Prompt Engineering (new technique using Al models like GPT, which will probably not be the case in your situation, but it should stay if using Al)

Web Scraping (data collection using code from web pages if applicable)

RELEASE 1: [Name of Release and its objective]

This is the first of likely multiple "Release" sections, detailing the development of iterative releases/versions of the software

Introduction

Planification du Premier Release (Planning of the First Release)

Sprint 1 : [Sprint objectives]

Sprint 1 Backlog

Analyse des Besoins (Needs Analysis)

Diagrammes des séquences (Sequence Diagrams)

Réalisation (Implementation)

Follow the same structure for Sprint 2, Sprint 3...

RELEASE 2: [Name of Release and its objective]

Details on the second release, following the same format as Release 1.

Introduction

Planification du Deuxième Release (Planning of the Second Release)

Sprint 1 : [Sprint objectives]

Sprint 1 Backlog

Analyse des Besoins (Needs Analysis)

Diagrammes des séquences (Sequence Diagrams)

Réalisation (Implementation)

Follow the same structure for Sprint 2, Sprint 3...

CONCLUSION GÉNÉRALE (General Conclusion)

A summary of the entire project, highlighting key achievements, lessons learned, and future directions.

Reflection

Additional Notes:

Diagrams: Pay close attention to the use of diagrams. UML diagrams (use case, sequence diagrams, class diagrams) are used to model the system. Architectural diagrams are also important. Include clear explanations of what each diagram represents.

References: The report is well-referenced, using a numbered list for citations (NETOGRAPHIE). Maintain a consistent citation style.

Iterative Development: The project is developed using an iterative approach (SCRUM), so each "Release" section is a cycle of planning, analysis, design, and implementation.

Adapt for Another Domain: The student's project is about a car rental application. Adapt the project context, terminology, and technologies to fit your own project domain.

By following this structure, you can create a well-organized and comprehensive project report for another project. Good luck!
